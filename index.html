    <p>One clear standout among boys' names is <strong>Jacob</strong>. As the chart shows, since 1999, 
            more than half a million boys have been given this name. 
            Jacob dominated the early 2000s, reflecting a broader trend toward strong, traditional names that
             resonated with many American families.</p>

        <p>Among girls, <strong>Emma</strong> proved to be just as iconic. More than 450,000 girls were named 
            Emily during the same period, making it one of the most enduring and beloved choices for 
            baby girls in the early 21st century.</p>

                 gaining strength with each new generation of parents.</p>

                <p>We filtered the data from this <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">source</a> to include only births from the year 1999 onward, grouped by name and sex, and summed the number of times each name was given.
                     The names with the highest total counts are the most popular since 1999.</p>
